# 🏫 Hostel Fee Management System

Welcome to the Hostel Fee Management System! 🌟

This system is designed to help manage hostel fees efficiently. It simplifies the fee collection process and keeps track of hostel fee payments. The system provides a user-friendly interface for both administrators and hostel residents. 💼

## 🕰️ History

I created this project to manage the hostel fees at Transit Men's Hostel-1, Tezpur University. After successfully implementing it in my hostel, I decided to share this project with the public. 

This project is still being used in my hostel. You can view it in action by clicking [here](https://tmh1-mess-management-system.free.nf/?i=1).
